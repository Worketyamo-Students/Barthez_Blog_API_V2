# Blog Management API


This is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for managing a blog system. The API provides user authentication via JWT, password hashing with bcrypt, and full CRUD operations for blog posts. It serves as the backend for a blog platform where users can sign up, log in, and manage their own blog posts.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and token-based authentication (JWT).
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage - using bcrypt.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
- **Send Email**: send mail to all users when they are login in the plateform
- **MongoDB Database**: Blog data stored using MongoDB.
- **Cross-Origin** Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for communication with a frontend.
## Tech Stack

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)**: JavaScript runtime for the backend.
Express.js: Web framework for building the API.
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**: NoSQL database for storing blogs and users.
- **[prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)**: ORM for MongoDB to define schemas and models.
- **[JWT](https://jwt.io/)**: JSON Web Token for secure authentication.
- **[bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)**: Library for hashing user passwords.
